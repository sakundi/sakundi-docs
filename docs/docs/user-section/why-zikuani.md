# Why do I need Zikuani?

## 🛑 The Problem with Traditional KYC and other identity systems

- 📸 Onboarding is slow and invasive (selfie + document) → high abandonment  
- 🕵️ Fraud risk: fake documents, synthetic identities, deepfakes  
- 🔐 Regulatory liability: storing passports/faces = hacker honeypot  
- 💸 High operational cost from manual reviews and data storage

---

## 🔑 Our Solution

**Identity with Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK):**

- ✅ Customers prove age, residency, or nationality **without sharing photos**  
- ✅ Fintech and DeFis remain compliant **without storing sensitive data**
- ✅ Instant onboarding → higher conversion rates
- ✅ Resistant to AI fraud (deepfakes can’t break ZK)

---

## 📊 Tangible Benefits

- 📉 **Lower abandonment**: up to -50% in onboarding  
- 💰 **Reduced compliance costs**: fewer manual reviews  
- 🛡 **Lower liability**: no stored PII, less exposure to fines  
- ⚡ **Faster time-to-market**: aligned with emerging regulations  

---

## 🤔 Common Objections

**“Regulators want documents”**  
➡️ Response: ZK proofs are official cryptographic attestations issued by trusted entities  

**“This sounds too experimental”**  
➡️ Response: Already proven in production (Polygon ID, Zama, zk-KYC in DeFi)  

**“Will it be more expensive?”**  
➡️ Response: Clear ROI → less fraud, no PII storage, lower review costs

## 🌍 Use Cases

- 🏦 **Banks & Neobanks**: Faster onboarding, reduced regulatory risk  
- 📱 **Fintech and DeFi lenders & payment apps**: Seamless compliance  
- 🌐 **DeFi & DAOs**: Trusted identity without sacrificing privacy

## 💡 As a conclusion

*"With traditional KYC, you pay to store the very data hackers want most: passports and faces.  
With Zero-Knowledge Proofs, your customers prove compliance instantly, regulators are satisfied, and you store no sensitive data.  
That means **less fraud, less risk, and higher conversion**."*
