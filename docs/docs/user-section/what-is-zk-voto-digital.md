# ZK Digital Vote: Anonymous and Secure Voting in Costa Rica

**ZK Digital Vote** is a project that seeks to address the **problem of personal data privacy** in the digital age. Often, personal information shared online can be stolen by cybercriminals or distributed on the web [1]. To counter this, **ZK Digital Signature** was created, a technology that allows **proving a person's identity without needing to send or reveal their sensitive data** [1]. This means a person can be anonymous, but still demonstrate who they are [1].

This project has been presented at events like Tiko Blockchain, considered one of the biggest blockchain conferences in Costa Rica, to an audience of over 300 people [1]. The live demonstration of **ZK Digital Vote**, one of the most interesting and common use cases of ZK Digital Signature, allows users to **vote anonymously** [1].

## What is Needed to Use the System?

To interact with this technology, a resident or citizen of Costa Rica who wishes to participate in the voting or identity system anonymously needs:

*   A **laptop computer** [1]. (Currently, it only works on laptops, but the idea is for it to work on mobile phones in the future) [1].
*   The **Costa Rican Digital Signature** [1]. This is basically like a document that allows you to sign other documents with cryptography and is considered an electronic identity [1]. (In the future, it is also planned to use the new electronic identification that will be available in Costa Rica) [1].

## How Does ZK Digital Vote Work?

The basic operation centers on the digital certificate contained within the Digital Signature card [1]. The system uses the following steps:

1.  A **desktop application extracts the digital certificate** from the card [1].
2.  **Circom circuits** are used to **transform the digital certificate into zero knowledge proofs (ZK)** [1].
3.  With these ZK proofs, **the user's identity is validated without actually sending their real identity information** [1]. Identity is just proven using ZK [1].
4.  This process generates a **verifiable credential** which is used to identify the user anonymously [1].
5.  With this validated anonymous identity, the user can interact with the blockchain [1].
6.  The system uses the **Polygon blockchain** to actually send and collect the votes [1]. Polygon serves as a safe place where people can interact with this voting system [1].
7.  Since the identity is anonymous and no sensitive data is sent, the user can **vote anonymously** [1].
8.  At the same time, **people can see how the votes are cast** (the transaction on the blockchain is visible) [1] and the **results are completely transparent and trustworthy** [1].

## Steps to Use the ZK Digital Vote Application

To use the ZK Digital Vote application, the user must follow these steps:

1.  Go to the URL: **voto.sakundi.io** [1].
2.  **Install the desktop application** from the downloads link on the GitHub page [1]. Instructions are available for Linux, Mac OS, and Windows [1].
3.  **Configure the MetaMask wallet** to use the **Polygon testnet called Amoy** [1]. This involves configuring the explorer, URL, and other necessary settings for Amoy [1].
4.  Return to the digital voting website [1].
5.  You will be requested to **link your MetaMask wallet** (the Amoy address) with the web page that will be used for voting [1].
6.  On the digital voting website, you will have to **identify yourself as a Costa Rican citizen or resident** [1].
7.  The web application will prompt you to open the desktop application [1].
8.  In the desktop application, **insert your Digital Signature card and enter your PIN** [1].
9.  The desktop application will extract the certificate, perform the ZK process, and generate a verifiable credential [1].
10. After completing the process in the desktop application, the user will return to the digital voting website [1].
11. The user will be able to use their blockchain address and will see a **demo voting question** [1].
12. **Select the preferred option** and click vote [1].
13. The MetaMask wallet will open to **send the transaction** [1].
14. After a moment, a confirmation will appear on the website that the vote was successful [1].
15. Finally, you can access the "view results" link to **see the final voting results** [1].
