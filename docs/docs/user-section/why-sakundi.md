# Why do I need Sakundi's solutions?

<div className="sakundiSolutions"></div>

Digital and personal privacy is every day more at risk in the current cyberspace. Sakundi focuses on protect users on the different Blockchain layers and also in traditional Web technologies.

ZK Firma Digital, a Sakundi's project, is a zero-knowledge protocol that allows Costa Rican Firma Digital card owners to prove their identity in a privacy preserving way. It provides a set of tools to generate and verify proofs, authenticate users and verify proofs off/on-chain.

The project aims to develop a zero-knowledge proof infrastructure solution for enhancing Costa Rica's digital identity system. Our goal is to strengthen citizen privacy by minimizing data collection, enabling individuals to access a wide range of valuable services without disclosing sensitive information.
Rationale

The Costa Rican government offers an advanced digital identity system (Firma Digital) that allows residents or entities to sign documents with a digital identity validated by the central bank as CA and authenticate themselves on various public or private websites and services. However, there is a significant privacy concern related to sensitive data in Costa Rica. A small amount of identity information, such as a national ID number or car plate number, can lead to extensive data collection. Private companies can use this kind of data to harvest citizen data, for instance, by calling and offering them products or services without any previous request or permission. This fact is exceptionally relevant now that big corporations harvest indiscriminate user data to train AI models. Even worse, criminals are collecting this same data to perform identity theft and fraud, sometimes even making fraudulent calls from the jails.

Our project aims to address these privacy issues by developing a zero-knowledge proof infrastructure using blockchain technology and ZK circuits. This solution will enable citizens to verify their identity and provide specific information without revealing actual personal details. By minimizing the distribution of sensitive data across various institutions and companies, we can significantly reduce the risk of data theft. Additionally, this system can authenticate users for diverse services, ensuring they are real individuals and not bots, without requiring sensitive information such as email addresses or phone numbers.
