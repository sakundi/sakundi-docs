# Why do I need Sakundi's solutions?

<div className="sakundiSolutions"></div>

Privacy is becoming increasingly important in cyberspace. There is growing concern about the protection of individuals' sensitive data. A small amount of identity information, such as a national ID number or a car license plate number, can lead to extensive data collection. Private companies can use this type of data to gather information about citizens, for example, by calling them to offer products or services without any prior request or consent. This is especially relevant now that large corporations are indiscriminately collecting user data to train artificial intelligence models. Even worse, criminals are also collecting this data to carry out identity theft and fraud, sometimes even making fraudulent calls from prisons.

Several governments, including the Costa Rican one, offer an advanced digital identity system (Firma Digital) that allows residents or entities to sign documents with a digital identity validated by the Central Bank as a Certification Authority (CA) and authenticate themselves on various public or private websites and services. ZK Firma Digital, a project by Sakundi, is a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) protocol that enables Firma Digital cardholders, initially from Costa Rica, to prove their identity in a privacy-preserving manner. It provides a set of tools to generate and verify proofs, authenticate users, and perform proof verifications both on-chain and off-chain.

The project aims to develop a zero-knowledge proof infrastructure solution to enhance the digital identity system. Our goal is to strengthen citizens' privacy by minimizing data collection, enabling individuals to access a wide range of valuable services without disclosing sensitive information.

Our project seeks to address these privacy concerns by developing a zero-knowledge proof infrastructure using blockchain technology and ZK circuits. This solution will allow citizens to verify their identity and provide specific information without revealing actual personal details. By minimizing the distribution of sensitive data across various institutions and companies, we can significantly reduce the risk of data theft. Additionally, this system can authenticate users for diverse services, ensuring they are real individuals and not bots, without requiring sensitive information such as email addresses or phone numbers.

Sakundi focuses on protecting users across different layers of blockchain technology and traditional Web technologies.
